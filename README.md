# Scuffed Beat Saber Characteristic Editor
Early alpha command line based characteristic editor for the [SongCore](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/SongCore) Beat Saber mod. Issues with this program are expected cause I'm a genius.

## Usage
Drag the directory to the map you want to edit into the terminal window then press enter. Then you can pick out the characteristic you want to edit and add images to (if wanted).
